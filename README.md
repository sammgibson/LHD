This program uses the code library provided by Beautiful Soup: "https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"

Our group's goal with this program is to create a simple web scraper that gets information from Twitter. As of now we are not sure what we wish to do with these tweets, but for now we are web scraping The President's tweets.
